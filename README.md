# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python
Board Representation:

The game is represented by a 3x3 grid, often implemented using a nested list in Python. Each cell of the grid can be empty, marked by 'X', or marked by 'O'.
Displaying the Board:

The game includes functionality to display the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. This is crucial for players to see the positions of 'X' and 'O' on the grid.
Taking User Input:

The program takes user input to determine the row and column where a player wants to place their symbol ('X' or 'O'). This typically involves prompting the user to enter row and column indices.
Making Moves:

The game logic includes mechanisms to update the board based on the player's input. Before making a move, the program checks whether the chosen cell is empty and updates it with the player's symbol.
Checking for a Winner:

There's a function or logic to check for a winner after each move. This often involves examining rows, columns, and diagonals for a sequence of the same symbol ('X' or 'O').
Switching Players:

To ensure turns alternate between players, there's a mechanism to switch between 'X' and 'O' after each move. This ensures fair gameplay.
Handling a Tie:

The game logic includes a mechanism to detect when the game results in a tie. This occurs when the entire board is filled, and no player has achieved a winning sequence.
Game Loop:

The entire game logic is encapsulated within a main game loop. This loop continues until there's a winner or a tie. It iterates through the process of displaying the board, taking user input, making moves, and checking for outcomes.
End of Game Message:

After the game concludes, there's a display message indicating the winner or declaring a tie. This provides closure to the players and communicates the outcome of the game.
This Tic-Tac-Toe project serves as a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic game, covering fundamental aspects such as user interaction, game state management, and win/draw conditions. The absence of specific code snippets provides a conceptual overview of the project structure and functionality.
